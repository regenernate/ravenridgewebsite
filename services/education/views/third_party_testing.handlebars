    <h1>Why is product testing important?</h1>
    <p>Being a relatively young industry, regulations and enforcement of regulations are a work in progress. In a rush to turn a profit, <em>some organizations are behaving unscrupulously</em> in regards to consumer health and wellness.</p>
    <p><strong>This is not how we do business.</strong></p>
    <p>To ensure that any product you are purchasing contains the amount of CBD claimed, look for third-party testing on the product batch you are purchasing.</p>

    <h2>Heavy Metals and Mycotoxins</h2>
    <p>As with any plant growing in soil, whatever is in the soil can also be in the plant. Metals and mycotoxins can be naturally occurring but also are concentrated when conventional agricultural inputs are used for years on end. Click the links below to see the test results from our product lines:
      <table class='top-margin question-table'>
        <tr><th>Year</th><th>Mycotoxins</th><th>Heavy Metals</th></tr>
