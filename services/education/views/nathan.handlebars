  <h1>Nathan</h1>

  <p>I have spent the better part of 5 days a week over the last 5 years toiling on the land at RavenRidge Family Farm.</p>
  <p>That’s right: I said <b>toiling</b>.</p>
  <p>I never really wanted to be a farmer. I didn’t ask for this. Life just has its own way of making you stand up and take notice. For me, that was the day my son was born, although it's taken me the better part of two years to appreciate it.</p>

  <p>I've been fortunate enough to have lived several lives in my four-plus decades on this planet. Most recently, I have adopted this role of caretaker to the RavenRidge land, but immediately before that I was a handyman, then a cell tower repairman. Before that an herbalist and student of permaculture. Prior to that I was a web developer and before that still, a student of Avian and Plant biology.</p>
  <p>My point is this: we are all something, and we all have the opportunity to try to be something else, tomorrow.</p>
  <p class='center-quote'>My hope is that we can all be something better, together.</p>
  <h2>Jarring Segue #1</h2>
  <p>I have a strange affinity for plants. I would not call it a green thumb, exactly. I have killed a full third as many lovely hemp ladies as I have grown out successfully.</p>
  <p>But there is something there … a primal sort of calling. I can feel it right now, even as I write this.</p>
  <p>We were born into the forests, and I feel certain that on some deep level we all long to return to them.</p>

  <h2>Jarring Segue #2</h2>
  <p>Speaking of useful plants, hemp certainly is an interesting one: it casually provides superfood, fiber, fodder and medicine, while asking relatively little of the land in return. Yet hemp has become, as all things do in America, a fad.</p>
  <p>Folks are growing it labelled <em>good for the land</em> while tilling and hilling bare, exposed soil. Planting more plants per acre and leaving less residue behind. It is a travesty.</p>
  <p>If I've learned one thing about hemp over these three long years, it's this: <em>hemp in and of itself is not humanity’s salvation, but the way we choose to grow hemp, could be.</em></p>

    <h2>Back on Track</h2>
    <p>I've said it before, but the single most defining moment in my life took me nearly two years to appreciate as such. That moment was the birth of my son William into this world -- a world that at the time was becoming a scarier place by the moment, and has since been rocked by a global pandemic, increasingly intense climactic events, and an active attempt by a standing president to subvert our democracy and incite violence against American citizens.</p>
    <p>On a more personal level, Cynthia and I were still getting used to the routines of our relatively new life together, and she had only just begun processing the impact of <a href='/learn/cynthia#the_tornado'>the previous year’s tornado</a>.</p>
    <p>But in this moment, something changed -- and I have come to accept that it no longer matters whether I want to be a farmer or not. It doesn’t matter that it was the hardest thing to do each morning just to drag myself out into the cold, dark world. It doesn’t matter that we still can't be certain we will ever make the farm work.</p>
    <p>It just has to be done.</p>
    <p>William, my son, just like all of the other sons and daughters out there, deserve to grow up into a world of promise and opportunity. They deserve to inherit a world every bit as vibrant and glorious as is the world of today, but it is going to take significant change to make that a reality.</p>

  <p class='center-quote'>That kind of change is what I am all about.</p>
