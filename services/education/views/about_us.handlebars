    <p>... eventually the surrounding area was settled by foreigners.
      The land changed hands many times until it became a <em>small family tobacco farm</em>.</p>
    <p>It was still considered the most beautiful and
      abundant land to be found in the shadows
      of the mountain, and it was a good place
      to raise a family.</p>

    <p>The fertile fields provided the owners a good living,
      but over time, both the land and its owners wore out,
      and their children moved on.</p>
      <p>Those who were left retired to a small
      corner of the property where they remain to this day.</p>

    <h2>New Owners, Renewed Purpose</h2>
    <p>In 2007, Richard and Michele purchased that worn out farm and became its stewards.
      They took their time to learn the lay of the land,
      and they nurtured their committment to recover the diversity and abundance
      that once thrived here all on its own.</p>

  <h2>Enter Cynthia and Nathan</h2>
    <img class='center-logo-part' src="/logo_sauratown.png" alt='Artistic rendering of Sauratown mountain outside of King, North Carolina. Home of Hidden Springs Horse Farm' />
    When the time came for the Wheeler's son Nathan to again settle, after spending some hard years reconnecting with the natural world, he together with his wife Cynthia
    took on the task of farming the land at RavenRidge. For her part, Cynthia brought a wealth of crucial prior knowledge and experience as an animal caretaker.</p>
    <p>They have burrowed deep into this new, yet ancient way of managing land. Combining a deeply compassionate style with the newest science around what makes regenerative agriculture work.</p>

    <p>Cynthia and Nathan also manage a second farm
      called <b>Hidden Springs</b>, on Cynthia's family land
      at the base of Sauratown mountain. Here is where they live, tend the forests, and raise and train animals of all kinds ( including two children ).</p>

    <h2>The Short of It</h2>
    <p class='center-quote'>The ambition for RavenRidge is to turn the land management pratices of the past into possibility for a brighter future.</p>
    <section class='important-summary'>
      <p>We raise and graze animals with compassion.<br />
        We grow hemp following regenerative practices.<br />
        And we make <a href='/shop'>CBD products</a> from that hemp.</p>

  <h2>The Rest of the Family</h2>
  <p>We'd be remiss not to mention at least some of the other folks who have contributed to the farm. As with any endeavor, it wouldn't be possible without support.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>Grandma Hunt</h3>
    <p>Grandma lives on the farm and has been involved from the beginning. She carried chicken poop from vine to vine at the original grape planting. She has seen animals of every sort come and go. And although she did spend much of her youth on a farm, she certainly never expected to spend her final years on one too!</p>

    </div>
    <p>In her ninth decade, Neva is still helping out wherever she can and has weighed in as many buckets of hemp as anyone over the past three years.</p>
    <p>Thank you Grandma Hunt. We love you.</p>

    <h3>Grandkids, Cousins, Nieces and Nephews</h3>
    <p>Richard and Michele have two other children who, along with their families, have helped out whenever possible. Their creative minds, young backs, and constant encouragement have made life easier.</p>

    <h3>The Other Brother, and Borrowed Land</h3>
    <p>This brother belongs to Richard, so he's uncle to half of us. Ernie and his wife Cathy, standing on the tree trunk in the picture above, run their own successful farm business out of a small plot of land adjacent to RavenRidge. They are educators and homesteaders, and they help with the animals when no-one else is around.</p>

    <p>The spent substrate from their mushroom business is one of the core ingredients in our hemp growing soil!</p>

  <h2>The animals</h2>
  <p>Last but not least, there is the menagerie of animals that travel from farm to farm, doing what they do best.</p>
  <p>The hogs are rooting.</p>
  <p>The chickens are laying eggs and eating bugs.</p>
  <p>The cows are grazing contentedly.</p>
  <p>And the horses ... well, they are just hanging out waiting for a scratch.</p>
