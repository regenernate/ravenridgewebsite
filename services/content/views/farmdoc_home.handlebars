  <h2>Why we made these guides.</h2>
  <p>In 2019 <a href='https://news.gallup.com/poll/263147/americans-say-cbd-products.aspx'>a Gallup poll found that 14% of Americans use CBD products</a>, and given <a href='https://www.statista.com/statistics/760498/total-us-cbd-sales/'>the increase in CBD sales</a> since then, its likely that number has gone up.  This has created a “wild west” market for unregulated products, with a lot of hype, making it difficult for folks considering trying CBD to find reliable information that can help them make decisions about whether they should try it, how to find a high quality product, how to use it.</p>
  <p class='center-quote'>Richard, the Farm Doc, knows from first hand experience how challenging it can be for clinicians and patients to have a fact based conversation about the latest cure-all in this kind of environment: to get past the hyperbole, and have a discussion about what we do and don’t know.</p>
  <p>He wrote these guides to assist Physicians and other clinicians, patients, and folks considering taking CBD in getting past the hype, having these conversations, and making well informed decisions.</p>
