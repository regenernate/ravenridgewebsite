<h2>What is a Regenerative Family Farm</h2>
<p>A <em>regenerative family farm</em> is one on which the land, the plants and the animals, both native and introduced, whether wild or cultivated, are all encouraged to thrive within the larger ecosystem they are a part of. On a regenerative family farm, inputs of external resources are comprised of waste-stream organic materials and community surplus rather than refined chemicals and petrochemical fertilizers. Its a place where the microbiology in the soil is considered the true grower of crops, and so systems are employed to manage the soil that will encourage that microbiology to be as diverse, resilient and efficient as possible. </p><p>Above ground, diversity is as highly encouraged, as we find that a wider variety of predators can manage a wider variety of pests without resorting to chemical or biological commercial products. Regenerative agriculture requires a commitment of time and integrity which begins to pay off immediately in piece of mind, but pays true dividends for future generations as the soil left behind from these practices grows richer over time, sequesters more carbon into the soil, and produces higher quailty crops with fewer external inputs year over year. It is a system that takes advantage of the way natural systems work, rather than fighting against those systems. And our lives as regenerative farmers, are equally enriched as a result of these practices.
