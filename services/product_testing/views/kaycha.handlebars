<h2>Why should product tests be hosted on a testing company's website?</h2>

<p>Since early February of 2020, we have been using <a href='https://www.kaychalabs.com'>Kaycha Labs</a> for our COA testing, a USDA and DEA certified testing facility in Kentucky.
Kaycha offers to freely host COA test results on their web servers to ensure complete transparency. It is surprisingly easy to modify test result documents in ways that are visually imperceptible, even without lots of technical expertise.
As a result, we have opted to avoid the question altogether and never handle the coa test documents that you view by clicking the link above.</p><p>This is an industry best practice, and you should consider it carefully when selecting a cbd product to use, particularly when using that product internally.</p>
